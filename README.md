# LOST_DATA_RETRIEVAL
Title: Lost Data Recovery Project

Welcome to our Lost Data Recovery Project! Here, we've been busy exploring ways to rescue lost data from digital devices. We've done a lot of digging, tried out different tools, and even wrote papers and made presentations about our findings. One tool we really tested out is called Autopsy, and we've explained how to use it step-by-step in our presentation.

What You'll Find:
1. **Research Papers**: We've written up our discoveries in easy-to-understand papers. They cover everything we've learned about getting back lost data, so anyone can understand.

2. **Presentation (PPT)**: Our presentation breaks down our project into simple steps. You'll learn about the tools we've used and how they work, including Autopsy.

3. **Report**: This report tells the story of our project journey. It explains what we did, what worked, and what didn't, so you can learn from our experiences.

4. **Tool Testing - Autopsy**: Autopsy is one of the tools we tried out for recovering lost data. In our report, we talk about how well it worked and whether we recommend using it.
